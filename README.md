# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to build dynamic Webpage that contains a table of UFO sighting data. We started the process by building a table to hold and neatly display the UFO data. Then added filters of that table which lets users refine their search on more than one level. Then, a table was inserted into and visually displayed by an HTML PAGE. We used basic HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS to build and style the entire page. we also included an attention grabber header, article summary, and brief article.

## Resources
Data Source: data.js
Software: E6+, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, D3

## Results
This is the initial page. the page displays, date, location, UFO descriptive data, and comments. 
The user can re-initialize the page by clicking on the navbar at the top.

## Summary
Drawbacks:
-The data is limited and outdated since it is not linked to a "live" source.
-Including a button to clear the filters is also needed. The button would be located below the last filter.

Future Development: 
-Add functionality to pull the data from a live source that includes current and archived data not limited to only the United States, but globally.
