# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to build dynamic Webpage that contains a table of UFO sighting data. We started the process by building a table to hold and neatly display the UFO data. Then added filters of that table which lets users refine their search on more than one level. Then, a table was inserted into and visually displayed by an HTML PAGE. We used basic HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS to build and style the entire page. we also included an attention grabber header, article summary, and brief article.

## Resources
